## A note about licensing
This program was, from July 1 to Sebtember 7 of 2017, licensed as the horrendous (default) "All Rights Reserved". However, from September 7 onwards, it is apparently a moot point: not only have I not heard back from the commisioner, but my GitHub account has been breached, so the code in this repo has already been seen, and to cap it all off, I no longer have the money to have a GitHub subscription. That is why, from this point on, I am reversing the wrongs and switching the rites. The now-used GPLv3 can be found in the LICENSE file.
